<h1> Flying around the Globe </h1>
<h2> Wednesday, February 08, 2012 </h2>

<p> I'm currently living in <b>Lyon, France</b>, and soon I will
start moving around a lot so people started asking me to keep them updated and
to send them photos from where I go. This is the place where I'll post updates
and photos.

<p> In May 2012, I'll fly to <b>San Fransisco</b>, and I'll be working there as
a Google intern for 3.5 months. I've already been to the US once before,
spending a week in New York a couple of years ago, and I'm already very excited
about this new trip! I'll get to see <b>Mountain View</b>, the <b>Silicon
Valley</b>, and hopefully I'll be able to visit as much as I can of the <b>West
Coast</b>.

<p> After that, I'll be spending a few months in <b>China</b>. This should
happen around September 2012, and I'll be studying either in <b>Beijing</b>
or in <b>Shanghai</b>. I kind of hope for Beijing but I don't know where I'll
end up yet. During my semester, I'll get to visit the big eastern chinese
cities, and I also definitely want to see the <b>Great Wall</b>. I'm open to
any suggestion, and you're welcome to come and visit me while I'm there, that
means before January 2013.

<p> That's all for today. See you soon.
