<h1> Google Travel </h1>
<h2> Wednesay, April 18, 2012 </h2>

<p> Well I just called Google Travel to book my plane tickets and here they
are!

<p> May 09, <b> Paris → Reykjavik → Seattle → San Francisco! </b>

<p> Aug 20, <b> San Francisco → London → Paris! </b>

<p> The stop at <b>Reykjavik, Iceland</b> is awesome! I've never set foot there.
In fact, apart from Paris and London, this is all unexplored territory for me.
I sure hope to take a few photos to share with you.

<h1> Around the Globe </h1>
<h2> Wednesday, February 08, 2012 </h2>

<p> Dear friends,

<p> I'm currently in <b>Lyon, France</b>, and soon I will start travelling
around for a year or so. I'm proud to present this sweet little
place I built, where I'll post cool updates and nice photos from wherever I go.

<p> In May, I'll fly to <b>San Fransisco</b>, and I'll be working there as
a Google intern for 3.5 months. This is really exciting as I'll get to see
<b>Mountain View</b>, the <b>Silicon Valley</b>, and as much as I can get of the
<b>United States of America</b>!

<p> Right after that, I'll spend one semester in <b>China</b>. This should
happen around September, and I'll be studying Computer Science in the famous
<b>Tsinghua University</b> in <b>Beijing</b>. During my time there, I'll get to
visit the big eastern chinese cities, and I most definitely want to see the
<b>Great Wall</b>. I'm open to any suggestion, and you're welcome to come and
visit me while I'm there, that means before January 2013.

<p> That's all for today. See you soon.
