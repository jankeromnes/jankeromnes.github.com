<h1> Why Open Source? </h1>
<h2> Friday, February 24, 2012 </h2>

<p> A lot of people ask me why I do <b>Open Source</b>. Don't I fear that my ideas get stolen,
and used by some evil company to make money behind my back? The answer is simple: not at all.
I actually encourage people to "steal" ideas from others, because that's <b>how
ideas spread, get refined and enriched</b>. That's how the whole creative process functions,
from the tiny spark of genious to the full-blown amazing new project. I would
feel great honor if someone deemed my ideas worth putting into their own projects, and such
personal satisfaction is far more precious to me than making big money on secrets, or forcing
everybody to put my name everywhere.

<p> The Open Source philosophy may seem a little idealistic, but in fact
it's not. Open Source works, because it's <b>a logical and very natural approach to
doing things</b>. When you want to go and make something cool because you just had an awesome idea,
your very first thought is not (and should not be) how to protect this idea from the evil
rest of the world so you can make money with it. Instead of isolating yourself and living in
constant paranoia, you should share your views with the most people you can; this way you
get feedback and valuable new input, and only then can you begin to see the shape of
what you are going towards. Instead of working with a very few people
you think you can trust, choose <b>the whole World as a workforce</b> for your projects.

<p> This approach actually works for real companies like <b>Mozilla</b> who recently tripled
their workforce; <b>Google</b> the internet giant behind the yearly Google
Summer of Code, encouraging people around the globe to contribute to open source software
projects; <b>Red Hat</b> going for the

barrier as the world's largest 100% open source business; and so many more, their numbers growing faster
and faster.
