<h1> Modelling all known Space in 3D </h1>
<h2> Wednesday, February 08, 2012 </h2>

<p> As a big space-enthusiast, I always wanted to get <b>a better feeling of what's
out there</b>. This is why I read about space every day, check out new videos from
NASA / ESA / SpaceX and watch Science Fiction movies and series. But this isn't
enough. I want to be able to see and explore things for myself.

<p> This is why I instantly loved
<a href=http://earth.google.com>Google Earth</a> when it came out. I
believe that
it's an awesome project, even if it's still largely unfinished. <b>Exploring Earth
is awesome.</b> But not being able to zoom out more, to detach from earth and to
wander around on your own is a huge limit. I want to go from Earth to the Moon,
to Mars, to the Sun, to Alpha Centauri and back again, all by myself. I want to
be able to see where Kepler 22b is when I read about it. And I want to get <b>a general
idea of where we currently are</b> in our solar system and in our galaxy; where our galaxy
is located in our universe and where we're headed.

<p> <b>This called for a new project</b>. I wanted something that didn't exist yet, and
I had two options: Sit and wait for it to happen, or get my hands dirty and do
it myself, which is usually more fun. This is why I started working on
<a href=https://github.com/jankeromnes/skywalker>SkyWalker</a>, a <b>GPS-like
navigation system for Space</b>, featuring modern web-based 3D technologies and using
real data from NASA. Follow the link to know more about it, or play with this
<a href=http://jan.keromnes.com/skywalker>demo</a> first.
