<h1> Modelling all known Space in 3D </h1>

<p> As a big space-enthusiast, I always wanted to get a better feeling of <b>what's
out there</b>. This is why I read about space every day, check out new videos from
NASA / ESA / SpaceX and watch Science Fiction movies and series. But this isn't
enough. I want to be able to see and explore things for myself.

<p> This is why I instantly loved
<a href=http://earth.google.com>Google Earth</a> when it came out. I
believe that
it's an awesome project, even if it's still largely unfinished. Exploring Earth
is awesome. But not being able to zoom out more, to detach from earth and to
wander around on your own is a huge limit. I want to go from Earth to the Moon,
to Mars, to the Sun, to Alpha Centauri and back again, all by myself. I want to
be able to see where Kepler 22b is. And I want to get a general idea of where we
currently are in our solar system, in our galaxy, where our galaxy
is located in our universe, and where we're headed.

<p> This called for a new project. I wanted something that didn't exist yet, and
I had two options: Sit and wait for it to happen, or get my hands dirty and do
it myself. This is why I started to work on
<a href=https://github.com/jankeromnes/skywalker>SkyWalker</a>, a GPS-like
navigation system for Space, featuring modern web-based 3D technologies and using
real data from NASA. Follow the link to know more about it, or try it out
as an early <a href=http://jan.keromnes.com/skywalker>WebGL demo</a>.
