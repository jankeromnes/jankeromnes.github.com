<h1> Modelling all known Space in 3D </h1>
<h2> Wednesday, February 08, 2012 </h2>

<p> As a huge space-enthusiast, I need to <b>get a feeling of what's
out there</b>. I often read about space, watch new videos from
NASA, ESA, SpaceX and Science Fiction series and movies. But this isn't
enough. I want to be able to see and to <b>explore</b> things.

<p> This is why I love <a href=http://earth.google.com>Google Earth</a>,
an awesome project which is still largely unfinished. <b>Exploring Earth
is awesome.</b> But not being able to zoom out, to detach from Earth and to
wander around on your own is a huge limit. I'd like to go from Earth to the Moon,
to Mars, to the Sun, to Alpha Centauri and back again. I'd love to see where
Kepler 22b is located when I read about it. And I want to get a good
idea of our position in the Solar System, in our Galaxy... where the Milky Way
is situated in our Universe and where we're all headed.

<p> This is why I started working on
<a href=https://github.com/jankeromnes/skywalker>Sky Walker</a>, a GPS-like
<b>Navigation System for Space</b>. It uses real data from NASA and modern 3D
web technologies to help you find your way through Space and Time.
You can look at my <a href=https://github.com/jankeromnes/skywalker>source code</a>
or play with this little <a href=http://jan.keromnes.com/skywalker>demo</a> first.
